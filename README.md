<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

These instructional materials focus on building skill in core and emerging topics in data science through a combination of lectures slides and example R exercises.  The aim is to learn essential concepts and methods that support practical application.

The topics posted here are selected from a larger body of material developed and presented for Data Science Rounds at the BC Centre for Disease Control.

Some basic familiarity with data manipulation in R is a helpful pre-requisite.  Having experience using *tidyverse* packages is an asset.  If review of these concepts would be helpful, start with the Data Wrangling sessions.
