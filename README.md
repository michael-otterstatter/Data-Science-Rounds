# Data Science Sessions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

These instructional materials focus on building skill in core and emerging topics in data science through a combination of lectures slides and example R exercises.  The aim is to learn essential concepts and methods that support practical application.

The topics posted here are selected from a larger body of material developed and presented for Data Science Rounds at the BC Centre for Disease Control.

Some basic familiarity with data manipulation in R is a helpful pre-requisite.  Having experience using *tidyverse* packages is an asset.  If review of these concepts would be helpful, start with the Data Wrangling sessions.

## Module 1 - Data Wrangling
This session provides a tutorial to efficient data importation and wrangling using tidyverse tools in R.  We also review the concept of 'tidy data' and its benefits for efficient data manipulation and analysis.  The accompanying R script provides examples of how to implement these tools.

## Module 2 - Sampling and Uncertainty
This session gives a basic refresher on some key concepts underlying statistical analysis, namely sampling and uncertainty.  We also show how these concepts are related to aspects of standard linear models.

## Module 3 - Intro to Regression Models
The first part of this session provides an overview of the structure of general linear models and generalized linear models.  Following this, we walk through a 3-part session on building a regression model using real data.  The accompanying R script illustrates in detail how this model building was performed.

## Module 4 - Intro to Survival Models
This 3-part session provides and overview of key concepts in the building and use of survival models.

## Module 5 - Intro to Geospatial Analysis
This 2-part sessions covers background and basic concepts for working with spatial data and generating maps in R.  The accompanying R script illustrates how to perform some of these operations, with a focus on the sf and tmap packages.
